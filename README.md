# Graph Neural Networks for Analysing Brain Neural Graphs

This project leverages Graph Neural Networks (GNNs) to decode and analyze the intricate structure of brain neural graphs derived from connectome data. 
By integrating advanced Graph convolutional and attention mechanisms, the model uncovers latent patterns in neural connectivity, offering valuable insights about the spiking and bursting behaviour. 

Implemented using PyTorch Geometric, the framework seamlessly handles complex graph data and demonstrates strong potential in cognitive neuroscience and brain network analysis.
